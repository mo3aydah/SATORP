# Product Context: Why, What, and How

## Why This Project Exists
SATORP (with 6 Degrees) wants employees to easily create and share a branded greeting card (e.g. for Ramadan). The app solves the need for a **simple, no-login, mobile-friendly** way to personalize a card and get a shareable image.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** SATORP employees.
- **Use case:** Creating a greeting (e.g. Ramadan) to share with family and friends via the downloaded image.

## Intended User Experience

### User Flow (Target)
1. **Language selection:** User lands on one page and selects Arabic or English.
2. **Three-step process** on the card page:
   - **Step 1 — Choose message:** Three predefined greeting messages; user picks one, then continues.
   - **Step 2 — Enter name:** User enters name; can go Back to step 1 or Continue to step 3.
   - **Step 3 — Preview and download:** Full card preview (background + message + name); user can Download PNG or Back to edit name.

The diagram below summarizes the flow.

```

*Description: After language selection, a strict three-step wizard: choose message → enter name → preview and download. Back navigation allows editing name or message.*

## Critical Success Factors (User Perspective)
- Clear, minimal steps; no confusion about what to do next.
- Correct RTL/LTR and language-specific copy (Arabic vs English).
- Downloaded image looks correct: readable text, proper layout, brand-consistent (Satorp, #2F388D).
- Works on typical mobile and desktop browsers (no special plugins).

## Product Vision Summary
A single-page (or minimal multi-step) flow where the employee chooses language, picks one of three greeting messages, adds their name, and downloads a finished card image—all with consistent branding and no account required.
